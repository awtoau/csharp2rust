# Working on the transpiler in parallel

Read this before starting any issue labelled `transpiler`.

## The one rule

**We are building a C#-to-Rust transpiler. We are not porting Renode.**

Renode is the corpus that tells us which C# constructs matter. It is the test
input, not the deliverable. Every change must be justifiable to someone
translating a completely different C# codebase.

## What an agent may touch

**One emitter module, and its own rules file. Nothing else.**

    scripts/emitter/lang/<construct>.py       generic C# -> Rust
    rulesdb/rules/lang/<construct>.json       its rules

    scripts/emitter/plugins/<idiom>.py        corpus-specific (Renode)
    rulesdb/rules/plugins/<idiom>.json        its rules

Creating a NEW pair is normal and expected -- a new construct is a new file.
Editing an existing pair is fine when the issue names it.

Everything else is **off limits**:

| do not touch | why |
|---|---|
| `scripts/emitter/core.py` | the dispatch registry; a change affects everyone |
| `scripts/emit.py` | the driver |
| `frontend/RenodeIngest/**` | a schema change forces everyone to re-ingest |
| `src/**/*_registers.rs` | converter OUTPUT, never an input |
| `rulesdb/schema.sql` | same as the ingest |
| another issue's module | the whole point of the split |

One module per agent means two agents never edit one file, and JSON rules
never merge-conflict because nobody shares a file.

## Requesting a master run

Some things only the maintainer does, because they affect every branch at once.
**Ask in the issue thread; do not do them yourself:**

- **Re-ingest** — needed if your construct requires a fact the corpus does not
  record (a Roslyn property we are not reading). Say which property and why.
  These get batched, because everyone must re-ingest together.
- **Regenerate** — the two `*_registers.rs` files are rebuilt from the
  converter after merge. Never commit them; never hand-edit them.
- **Schema change** — as above, and rarer.

If your construct needs an ingest change, that is a finding worth reporting on
its own. Eight have been found so far, and every one was a property Roslyn
already exposed that we were not reading. **None were Roslyn limitations.**

## How to know you are done

1. The named gap no longer appears in the generated file's `GAPS` header.
2. No NEW gap appears.
3. The construct is handled **generally**. Run the corpus query in the issue
   and state how many occurrences now emit. One site is not a rule.
4. The emitted Rust is **compared line by line against the C# it came from**,
   and that comparison is in the PR description.
5. Any difference Rust forces is recorded as a deviation in the rule, with
   reasoning -- never left looking like a faithful translation.
6. The gate passes:

        python3 scripts/check_paths.py
        python3 scripts/check_derived.py
        python3 scripts/check_layering.py
        python3 scripts/check_ingest.py
        cargo test --workspace

## "It compiles" is not evidence

Four bugs so far compiled cleanly and were wrong:

| bug | why it was invisible |
|---|---|
| `base.Reset()` emitted as a self-call | unbounded recursion; rustc accepts it |
| `/* GAP */` left in a loop increment | a comment is a valid statement; infinite loop |
| unmapped return type falling back to `-> ()` | silently dropped every caller's value |
| `16.0` emitted as `16` | f64 division became integer division |

None failed to compile. Read the generated output and compare it to the C#.

## Never edit by string match

Five edits in one session silently did nothing. Four were Python
`str.replace` against an anchor that had moved when `emit.py` was split into
modules; the fifth was a lookup against a key that had become a list entry.

Every one produced the same symptom, which is no symptom: the rule was in the
data, the code path was absent, and a rule with no handler reads exactly like
a rule that correctly declines. Two of them were reported as landed in commit
messages before anyone noticed.

**Use an editor that fails when its anchor does not match.** The remedy is a
tool that cannot silently miss, not a resolution to be careful -- each of
those five cost more to find than the fix cost to make.

The same principle is now enforced where it can be: a normalisation named in
data with no registered handler raises, rather than doing nothing.

## A path that emits nothing must say why

Six paths in one session produced no output and reported no reason. Each was
indistinguishable from a rule that correctly declines, so review could not
catch them -- there was nothing to see. Two were reported as landed before
anyone noticed; one survived two commits.

`core.must_explain` enforces the invariant where it applies: if a wrapped
path returns empty and neither `self.gaps` nor `self.unhandled` grew, it
raises.

It cannot be applied blindly. `emit_stmt` returns nothing for an `Empty`
statement, and `emit_call` returns nothing when a rule declares `emit: null`
deliberately. Both are correct.

**So decide which kind your path is when you write it.** If empty means "I
could not", wrap it. If empty means "there was nothing", say so in the
docstring. Leaving it undecided is how all six got in. The running audit is
issue #53.

## When you cannot do it generally

**Withhold and report a gap.** That is a correct outcome, not a failure.

A reported gap tells the next agent what to pick up. A plausible stub tells
nobody anything -- the `.with_reserved(9, 23)` that was invented by hand
survived a 33,000-access trace and 81% mutation testing, because behaviourally
inert wrong code is invisible to tests.

Never emit something that merely looks finished.

## The layer boundary is enforced

`scripts/check_layering.py` fails the commit if anything under
`scripts/emitter/lang/` or in the generic rules names a corpus construct --
Renode, a peripheral, a register, a bank, a UART.

If your mapping needs to know what a register is, it is a **plugin**, not a
language rule. Prose explaining WHY a mapping exists may cite the corpus; the
emitted template may not.

## Scope discipline

If your issue needs another issue's construct, **stop and say so in the
thread**. Do not implement both.

If you find a transpiler bug outside your module, **file it rather than fixing
it**. A drive-by fix in someone else's module is exactly the conflict this
protocol prevents.
