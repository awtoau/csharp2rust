//! `STM32_UART`, translated from Renode's C#. Issue #13.
//!
//! Faithful translation, not an improvement. Where the C# is wrong or
//! simplified, this is wrong or simplified in the same way — the oracle
//! certifies equivalence, and an "improved" port makes the trace comparison
//! meaningless. Deviations are recorded here, never applied silently.
//!
//! ## Generated vs hand-written
//!
//! The register LAYOUT lives in `uart_registers.rs`, produced by the converter
//! from the corpus and enforced byte-for-byte by `scripts/check_generated.py`.
//! This file holds only behaviour, which the converter does not yet emit.
//!
//! Three hand edits were deleted when the layout became generated, all of which
//! had survived the trace oracle and mutation testing:
//!   - `.with_reserved(9, 23)` and `(16, 16)` on USART_DR: **not in the C# at
//!     all**, and behaviourally inert, so nothing could catch them
//!   - a dummy `ValueId::default()` where the C# has a computed field with no
//!     storage; the generated version reports the gap instead
//!   - four shortened field names, which made the file unreproducible
//!
//! ## Deviations from the C#, all forced and all recorded
//!
//! 1. **No idle-line timer.** The C# schedules a machine action one UART frame
//!    after each received character to raise IDLE. That needs the time
//!    framework, which is not ported yet, so `WriteChar` sets the flag
//!    immediately. Affects IDLE timing only; recorded rather than hidden, and it
//!    is why `report_idle_line` exists as a seam.
//! 2. **`CharReceived` is a callback slot** rather than a C# `event`. Same
//!    single-subscriber behaviour the platform actually uses.
//!
//! ## Defects in the C#, reproduced faithfully
//!
//! `ORE` always reads 0 and `TXE` always reads 1. Both were described here, in
//! prose, in a file `check_generated.py` does not own — so nothing counted
//! them, nothing stopped the next reader "fixing" one, and a "fix" would break
//! a trace that passes at zero divergences over 33,164 accesses.
//!
//! They are now DATA: `uart_sr_ore_never_set` and `uart_sr_txe_always_set` in
//! `rulesdb/rules/bug_rules.json`, each carrying the ST citation that says the
//! C# is wrong, `fidelity` as its default, and a measured switch-impact.
//! `scripts/check_bug_rules.py` fails the commit if any of that goes missing,
//! and the generated `uart_registers.rs` now carries a `SRCBUG(...)` marker at
//! the register itself. This paragraph is a pointer, not a second copy.
//!
//! `TXE` is still why `update()` ORs in the transmit-empty interrupt
//! unconditionally, and that is stated at `update()` where the code is.
//!
//! ## Faithfully reproduced quirks
//!
//! - `BaudRate` is computed but used for nothing except the idle-line timeout.
//!   Renode models no transmission rate at all. Not a defect: nothing in ST
//!   contradicts it, so it is a modelling limit and not a bug rule.
