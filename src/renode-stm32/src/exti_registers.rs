//! Register layout for `STM32F4_EXTI`, GENERATED from the corpus.
//!
//! Do not edit: `scripts/check_generated.py` fails the commit if this
//! file differs from converter output. To change it, change the rules
//! in `rulesdb/rules/` or the C# it is derived from.
//!
//! Source: STM32F4_EXTI.DefineRegisters
//!
//! GAPS the converter reports rather than guessing:
//!   - BasicDoubleWordPeripheral..ctor `BasicDoubleWordPeripheral(IMachine)`: a base constructor, run by C# before the derived body and NOT inlined here -- inlining it means substituting the derived type's arguments for its parameters, so every field only this one assigns stays at Default
//!   - OffsetToString: withheld, reaches state this peripheral does not have: st.mapper
//!   - OnGPIO: withheld, cannot emit expr:DeclarationExpression
//!   - PendingRegister: callback for bit 0 reaches state this peripheral does not have: st.irq
//!   - Reset: withheld, reaches state this peripheral does not have: st.irq
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: no statement could be translated, so no initialiser is emitted at all
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 1 withheld -- not an assignment to the type's own storage, but VariableDeclarationGroup; an initialiser can only assign the struct it is building
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 2 withheld -- not an assignment to the type's own storage, but Loop; an initialiser can only assign the struct it is building
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 3 withheld -- assigns `Connections`, which the emitted struct has no storage for
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 4 withheld -- assigns `core`, which the emitted struct has no storage for
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 5 withheld -- the assigned value contains Invocation, which an initialiser cannot evaluate
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 6 withheld -- not an assignment to the type's own storage, but Invocation; an initialiser can only assign the struct it is building
//!   - STM32F4_EXTI..ctor `STM32F4_EXTI(IMachine, int, int)`: statement 7 withheld -- not an assignment to the type's own storage, but Invocation; an initialiser can only assign the struct it is building
//!   - SoftwareInterruptEvent: callback for bit 0 reaches state this peripheral does not have: st.irq
//!   - number_of_lines: withheld, calls withheld method(s): connections
//!   - state field `Connections`: needs trait `IGPIO` (D1 maps the field; the trait is issue #41). IGPIO declares 11 members, the corpus calls 5
//!   - state field `core`: reference-typed, so the object-graph rule maps it to `Gc<STM32_EXTICore>`; blocked: `STM32_EXTICore` has no emitted Rust type yet, so there is nothing to point at
//!   - state field `machine`: needs trait `IMachine` (D1 maps the field; the trait is issue #41). IMachine declares 112 members, the corpus calls 38
//!   - state field `sysbus`: needs trait `IBusController` (D1 maps the field; the trait is issue #41). IBusController declares 73 members, the corpus calls 66
