//! Register layout for `STMCAN`, GENERATED from the corpus.
//!
//! Do not edit: `scripts/check_generated.py` fails the commit if this
//! file differs from converter output. To change it, change the rules
//! in `rulesdb/rules/` or the C# it is derived from.
//!
//! Source: STMCAN.AddressIsWithinFilterRegistersArea
//!
//! GAPS the converter reports rather than guessing:
//!   - AddressToFilterBankIdx: withheld, cannot emit expr:SizeOf
//!   - AddressToRegIdx: withheld, cannot emit expr:SizeOf
//!   - CAN_RDT0R: the case body is not a layout shape -- 1 statement(s), the first a `Conditional`, compute rather than store. The register is NOT in the bank.
//!   - CAN_RDT1R: the case body is not a layout shape -- 1 statement(s), the first a `Conditional`, compute rather than store. The register is NOT in the bank.
//!   - CAN_RF0R: `ReceiveFifoRegister.GetValue()` composes a term this rule cannot place (the masked operand is computed, not stored); those bits are absent from the register.
//!   - CAN_RF0R: `ReceiveFifoRegister.SetValue()` has 2 statement(s) whose write semantics this rule cannot express (a conditional this rule cannot read); the bits they touch are emitted READ-ONLY, so a write the C# accepts is dropped here.
//!   - CAN_RF1R: `ReceiveFifoRegister.GetValue()` composes a term this rule cannot place (the masked operand is computed, not stored); those bits are absent from the register.
