"""A type whose corpus calls register combinators must emit registers, or gap.

This is the check that was missing, and its absence hid the largest defect
found so far.

WHAT IT CAUGHT
--------------
`compile_check.py` used to pick a type's register-defining method BY NAME --
the alphabetically first member whose name contains "Register". That selector
was wrong in two directions at once, and both were silent:

  * A type whose register map is built in its CONSTRUCTOR has no such member,
    so it matched nothing and was dropped from the run entirely. Four
    peripherals of the target platform vanished this way -- STM32F4_RCC (240
    combinator calls), STM32F4_RTC (157), STM32_RNG (24), STM32_CRC (15).
  * A type with an unrelated member called `Register` -- an
    `IPeripheralContainer.Register` overload, say -- selected THAT, and then
    emitted a module with an empty `define_registers`. STM32_Timer has 125
    combinator calls and emitted no register at all.

Neither produced an error, a gap, or a missing file. The modules simply were
not in the run, so every headline number -- module count, compile errors,
"N of M clean" -- was computed over the wrong denominator and read as complete.

That selector is gone: `scripts/register_owners.py` chooses the member whose
BODY contains register-form invocations, and every consumer imports it. This
check is what proves the replacement is doing its job, and it stays because the
next selector defect will look exactly like the last one -- a number that got
smaller with nobody told.

WHY THIS SHAPE OF CHECK
-----------------------
It compares two things that come from different places and must agree:

    the CORPUS says this type calls N register combinators
    the CONVERTER emitted M register definitions for it

If N > 0 and M == 0, something is wrong and nobody was told. That is true
whatever the cause -- a bad selector, an unmatched DSL family, a rule that
declined -- which is what makes it worth having. A check that knows only how
the converter works cannot notice the converter not running.

The rule this enforces is the project's own: a path that emits nothing must
say why. Here the path is a whole peripheral.

THE BLIND SPOT IN THAT SHAPE, AND WHAT COVERS IT
------------------------------------------------
`N` is a count of combinator calls, so a type that uses NO register DSL scores
N = 0 and passes -- while serving a memory-mapped bus and modelling every
register by hand in a `switch` on the offset. 393 corpus types answer
`ReadDoubleWord`/`ReadWord`/`ReadByte` with a body (the set
`scripts/census_memory_mapped.py` names, imported from there); 284 use the DSL
and **104 do not**. STMCAN is one: a 58-case switch and not a single `With*`
call anywhere in it.

Those 104 are a category, not a regression, and no plugin is coming for them --
the specific hand-rolled idiom appears twice in 448k lines, and a rule matching
two sites is a hand-written file wearing a rule's name. So they are counted and
named, and they do not fail this check.

What DOES fail is the sharp end of it: a type in that set for which the
selector picks a member anyway, so the converter emits a module whose
`define_registers` is empty. A module that looks like a peripheral and models
nothing is worse than no module, because the module list is what every other
number is computed over. Five types are in that state, down from seven.
