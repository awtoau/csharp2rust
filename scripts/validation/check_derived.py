"""Fail if derived data has been copied into hand-written source.

`check_paths.py` catches absolute paths. It caught nothing when platform reset
values were retyped from the `.repl` into Rust tests, because that is a
different class of violation: a *second source of truth*. Change the platform
and the copy keeps asserting the old value while passing — the failure is
silent, which is the worst kind.

So: any distinctive value that appears in a derived artifact must not also
appear literally in hand-written source. Derived files declare themselves
generated and are exempt; everything else must read the value, not repeat it.

Two deliberate limits, because a check that cries wolf gets disabled:

  - Only DISTINCTIVE values are checked. `0`, `1`, `16` occur everywhere and
    carry no provenance. Hex constants of >= 4 digits and multi-word names do.
  - A value is only a violation in a file that could reasonably have read it
    instead. Docs and commit-message-like prose are exempt: recording that
    `modeResetValue` is `0xA8000000` in a design note is documentation, not a
    second source of truth.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_derived.py
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_derived.log
Exit: 0 clean, 1 duplication found.
