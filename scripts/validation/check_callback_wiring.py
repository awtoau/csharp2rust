"""Every emitted callback must be wired into a register, exactly once.

WHAT IT CATCHES
---------------
The emitter translates a C# `writeCallback:` / `valueProviderCallback:` lambda
into a free function -- a closure cannot borrow the object it lives inside, so
the lambda becomes `fn name(bank, st, idx, old, value)`. Then, separately, it
chooses a combinator for the field. When it picks the `out` form
(`with_flag` / `with_value`), that combinator takes NO callback argument:

    fn power_control_14_writer(bank: &Bank<State>, st: &mut State, ...)  <- emitted
    .with_value(14, 2, &mut f.vos_value, FieldMode::READ_WRITE)          <- no slot

The function is now dead, the behaviour it carried is gone, and nothing says
so: no gap, no warning, and no rustc complaint, because the scratch crate and
the workspace crates both carry `#![allow(dead_code)]`. rustc has exactly this
lint and it is switched off -- this check is that lint, restricted to the
callbacks, and not suppressible.

Confirmed cost, from the audit: `STM32_PWR` loses the write callbacks that set
**VOSRDY** (bit 14 of PWR_CSR) and **ODSWRDY** (bit 17). Both are
`FieldMode.Read` in the C#, so the write callback was the ONLY thing that could
ever set them. Firmware that polls either after enabling over-drive spins
forever. `STM32SPI` loses two more.

"EXACTLY ONCE", NOT "AT LEAST ONCE"
-----------------------------------
Zero references is the dropped behaviour above. More than one is also wrong:
each emitted function corresponds to one C# lambda at one bit position, so a
second reference means two fields share a callback that the C# gave to one --
`with_fields_cb` spreads one callback across a group, but that is a single call
site and so a single reference. Both directions are reported.

ALSO: `FieldMode::default()` AS A TRANSLATION
---------------------------------------------
`FieldMode::default()` is `FieldMode::empty()` -- a field that answers neither
reads nor writes. `with_reserved` passes it deliberately, and those are
excluded here. Anywhere else it is `render_mode()` in scripts/core/csharp_emitter.py falling
off the end of its table:

    parts = [name for bit, name in sorted(FIELD_MODE.items()) if v & bit]
    return " | ".join(parts) if parts else "FieldMode::default()"

FIELD_MODE is gone: `render_mode` reads the enum from the corpus, and a mode it
cannot express withholds the field with a gap. `FieldMode::default()` is
therefore no longer reachable as a translation, and this check is what says so
if that changes.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_callback_wiring.py
      python3 scripts/check_callback_wiring.py --self-test
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_callback_wiring.log
Exit: 1 on a dead callback or a `FieldMode::default()` translation. PASSES at
      0; a hard gate, never a ratchet -- an emitted function nothing calls is
      not a degree of incompleteness, it is a translation the emitter performed
      and then discarded.

FLOOR: 0, at 2026-08-03. It was 9 dead callbacks + 1 empty mode on 2026-08-02
-- STM32_GPIOPort (5), STM32SPI (2), STM32_PWR (2), NVIC (the empty mode). The
nine were closed by `with_flag_cb` / `with_value_out_cb` / `with_values_cb`,
which landed on a parallel branch and could not be seen from here because this
parser had no model for them; the empty mode was closed by deriving the enum.
Reproduced at 3c96741 to confirm the nine were real and not a parsing artefact.
