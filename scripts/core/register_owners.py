"""Which member of a type actually defines its registers. Selected by CONTENT.

THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES
------------------------
Five scripts each carried their own copy of this query::

    SELECT t.name, MIN(mb.name) FROM type t
    JOIN member mb ON mb.type_id = t.id
    JOIN method m ON m.member_id = mb.id
    WHERE t.kind='class' AND m.has_body=1
      AND (mb.name LIKE '%Register%' OR mb.name LIKE '%DefineReg%')
    GROUP BY t.name

It picks the alphabetically first member whose NAME contains "Register", which
is wrong in two directions at once, and silent in both:

  * **Missed.** A type that builds its register map in its CONSTRUCTOR has no
    such member, so it matched nothing and was dropped from every run. Four
    peripherals of the target platform vanished this way -- STM32F4_RCC,
    STM32F4_RTC, STM32_RNG, STM32_CRC. Their registers were never emitted and
    nothing said so, because a type absent from the list produces no file that
    could be noticed missing.
  * **Mis-picked.** A type with an unrelated member called `Register` -- an
    `IPeripheralContainer.Register` overload, an
    `AddressIsWithinFilterRegistersArea` predicate -- selects THAT, and emits a
    module whose `define_registers` is empty. STM32_Timer has 125 combinator
    calls and emitted no register at all.

Neither produced an error. Every headline number -- module count, compile
errors, gap census, "N of M clean" -- was therefore computed over the wrong set
of types, and read as complete.

WHAT REPLACES IT
----------------
The corpus records what each body DOES, so ask that instead. Two facts about
each body, both read from the emitter's own definitions rather than from a
second copy of them:

  1. **Register forms** -- what LOCATES a register (`.Define(`, and a
     dictionary `Add`). A member with none of them has nothing the emitter
     could turn into a register, so it is not a candidate at all.
  2. **Combinators** -- `WithFlag`, `DefineValueField` and the rest, recognised
     by `RegisterDsl.combinator`, which knows the four declaring types the DSL
     is spread across. This is what makes a located register a register rather
     than a dictionary entry.

The winner is the candidate with the most COMBINATOR calls, then the most
forms, then the member name ascending -- so the selection is identical at `-j1`
and `-j32`.

Combinators rank ahead of forms because the dictionary form matches ANY
`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.Add`. STM32_SYSCFG's constructor adds sixteen GPIOs
to a dictionary in a loop, which `find_registers` will happily report as
sixteen located registers at four-byte spacing; its `CreateRegisters` locates
four and is the real one. Ranking on located registers picked the constructor
and emitted a module with no registers in it. Ranking on combinators picks
`CreateRegisters`, because a bag of `new GPIO()` has none.

A type whose every candidate has zero combinators is still selected, on the
form count alone. Dropping it would move a peripheral from "emitted a module
with no registers", which `check_emitted_registers.py` reports and names, to
"absent", which is the silence this whole module exists to remove.

Member KIND is not filtered. A constructor has a body, and so does an explicit
interface implementation of a property getter -- `.ctor` and
`IProvidesRegisterCollection<..>.get_RegistersCollection` are both real answers
in this corpus, and both were unreachable while the selector filtered on how
the member was spelled.

THE SAME QUESTION, ONE LEVEL DOWN
---------------------------------
`sub_blocks.child_register_method` already asks this for a NESTED child, and
already asks it by trying rather than by name -- it runs `find_registers` over
each candidate and keeps the first that yields anything. It restricts to
`mb.kind = 'method'`, which is precisely what hides a constructor, so the same
defect exists there one level down.

The two are not merged here because that file belongs to another issue. They
should be, and when they are, note that this module's ranking is deliberately
NOT "first candidate that locates registers": that rule picks STM32_SYSCFG's
constructor over its `CreateRegisters`, for the reason given above.

WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX
--------------------
The emitter takes a member NAME (`emit_file(type, method, module)`) and looks
it up with `WHERE t.name=? AND mb.name=?`, so an overloaded name, or two
distinct types sharing a short name, still resolve to whichever row sqlite
returns first. 21 of 728 candidates are ambiguous that way. That is a
pre-existing ambiguity in the emitter's lookup, not one introduced here, and
fixing it means changing the emitter's interface.

Nor does it invent a register method for a type that has none: STMCAN switches
on the address and uses no DSL at all, so no member of it contains a register
form and it is correctly absent. 105 of the 393 types that serve a memory-mapped
bus are like that. `check_emitted_registers.py` is the check that compares this
selection against two independent readings of the corpus -- combinator calls,
and bus entry points -- and reports what is still missing. Five hand-rolled
types still pass this selector on a stray dictionary `Add` and emit an empty
module; that check names them.

Not a check; nothing here exits non-zero. Run it to see the selection::
