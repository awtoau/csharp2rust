"""What is the smallest set of translated types that could actually RUN?

`compile_check.py` answers "how much of what the converter emits is
well-formed". That is a necessary question and not a sufficient one: a module
that compiles is not a peripheral. A peripheral is something a bus can hand an
address to.

So this asks the next question down, and it is the one that decides whether
anything can be assembled and executed:

  1. **Does the module compile?**            -- reuses compile_check's crate
  2. **Is it DRIVABLE?**                     -- does it expose the
     `read_double_word` / `write_double_word` pair the system bus dispatches
     through, so a generic caller can reach it without knowing its type?
  3. **Is it ON THE PLATFORM?**              -- does `docs/status/platform.json`
     (derived from the `.repl` by `scripts/parse_repl.py`) place it at an
     address?

`--platform <name>` measures against a Renode-shipped `.repl` instead, reusing
`parse_repl.parse` rather than a second parser -- the acceptance criteria are
Renode's own Robot tests, and those load Renode's own platforms, so "the floor"
has to be answerable for a board this repo does not own.

The intersection of the three is the floor. Everything outside it is a module
that compiles and cannot be run, which is the state the whole 560 are in today.

Two negative results this reports deliberately, because they are the shape of
the remaining work rather than a defect in it:

  * a platform peripheral with NO emitted module at all -- the converter only
    emits types with a register-defining method, so memories, the CPU and the
    bus itself are structurally outside it;
  * a drivable module whose `reset` arrives under a different name, or not at
    all. A generic caller needs ONE name per contract; `docs/status/dispatch.json`
    already measured that `reset` arrives under two and is missing from some.

It also probes the INFRASTRUCTURE the floor needs and the converter is never
asked for -- the bus, the memories, the machine. `compile_check.py` emits only
types with a register-defining method, so those have never been put in front of
the emitter at all, and "the converter cannot do them" was an assumption. It is
now a measurement, and it re-runs: if the emitter later learns one, the number
moves on its own.

Nothing is written to the repo except `docs/status/floor.json`; the scratch
crate lives under `tmp/`.

Run:  python3 scripts/floor_census.py
      python3 scripts/floor_census.py --reuse   # keep an existing scratch crate
Log:  ./tmp/logs/floor_census.log
Out:  docs/status/floor.json
Exit: 0 always -- this is a measurement, not a gate.
