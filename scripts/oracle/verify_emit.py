"""Is a hand-written translation reproducible from the corpus? Issue #35.

PLAN.md's standard: *a landed translation must be recreatable from the C# source
plus committed rules and scripts alone. File-specific hand edits are evidence the
generic process is incomplete.*

This tests that claim for the declarative half. It emits a peripheral's register
layout from the corpus and diffs it against the layout in the hand-written Rust.
Agreement means the file is rule output that happens to have been typed by hand,
and its `is_patch` flag can drop. Disagreement names exactly what the emitter
cannot yet produce.

Comparison is on the SEQUENCE OF COMBINATOR CALLS, not on text: whitespace,
line breaks and comments are formatting, and treating them as differences would
report noise. Argument values are compared exactly, because those are semantics.

Run:  python3 scripts/verify_emit.py [--target uart]
Log:  ./tmp/logs/verify_emit.log
Exit: 0 if every target is reproducible, 1 otherwise.
