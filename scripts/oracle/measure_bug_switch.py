"""Measure what switching a source defect to conformance actually costs.

THE FIELD THIS EXISTS TO FILL
-----------------------------
A bug rule records which traces fail if you throw its switch. The decision that
created the class is explicit that this field is the one that makes switching
safe rather than a coin flip, and that it must be MEASURED:

    switch the rule, regenerate, run the traces, record what moved, switch it
    back. A bug rule whose switch-impact is unknown is not finished.

An asserted number is worth nothing here. "No trace moves" and "we did not
look" produce the same JSON, and the second one is how the invented
`.with_reserved(9, 23)` survived a 33,000-access trace: behaviourally inert
wrong code is invisible until something runs it.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
For each stanza:
  1. regenerate its module with `csharp_emitter.py` -- once plain, once with
     `--conformance ID`
  2. report whether the two differ at all, and how
  3. replay every trace that maps to the stanza's C# type against BOTH, and
     count divergences

The replay uses the project's own oracle harness, so the number this prints is
the same number the ratchet in tests/generated_trace.rs asserts on. The
committed file is restored before the script exits, including on failure --
leaving a conformance module on disk would silently change what every other
gate is measuring.

Traces are found through `docs/status/platform.json`, which is derived from the
`.repl`. A trace is named for a platform INSTANCE and the stanza names a C#
TYPE, so the platform is the only thing that can join them; matching the names
directly finds almost nothing.

Run:  python3 scripts/measure_bug_switch.py [BUG_ID ...]     (default: all)
      python3 scripts/measure_bug_switch.py --write          (update the data)
Log:  ./tmp/logs/measure_bug_switch.log
Exit: 0 if every stanza was measured, 1 otherwise.
