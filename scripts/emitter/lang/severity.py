"""Severity tiers, and the marker a WARNING leaves in the emitted output.

LANGUAGE LAYER -- generic mechanism, no corpus knowledge. See check_layering.py.

Why this exists
---------------
There was ONE marker class. A `/* GAP */` means the converter could not express
something, and the member is WITHHELD -- so a gap is loud, countable, and can
never be mistaken for a translation. There was no way at all to say the other
thing:

    this DID emit, and its semantics differ from the source.

Three mappings were in exactly that position, each one described accurately in
its rule file and invisible everywhere else: a sort that discards its key
selector and does not sort, a lazy sequence materialised eagerly, and a
multicast subscribe/unsubscribe pair collapsed to a single subscribe. Prose in a
JSON file cannot be counted, cannot be grepped in the output, and cannot fail a
build, so all three read as faithful mappings to anyone reading the Rust.

The mechanism already existed for exactly one of them and was never generalised:
the `lock` mapping emits a marker comment at every site it touches. This is that
mechanism, made general -- a severity on the mapping, a marker in the output, and
a number that can be ratcheted.

Tiers
-----
  faithful   equivalence is claimed. No marker; the ordinary case.
  warning    it emitted, and the semantics DIFFER. Marker at the site.
  bug        the SOURCE is defective and this reproduces the defect. Marker at
             the site, under its own tag. See below.
  gap        it did not emit. The member is withheld and the reason is in the
             file header. Handled elsewhere; named here so the ladder is one
             ladder rather than two unrelated ones.

The bug tier, and why it is not the warning tier
------------------------------------------------
A warning says `our mapping is narrower than the source`. That is a statement
about the converter, it is countable, and the count is meant to fall as the
converter improves.

A bug says `the source is narrower than the thing it models`. That is a
statement about the INPUT. It is not ours to fix -- fidelity is the default
precisely because the oracle certifies equivalence with the source, so a
corrected output is a FAILED output. Sharing a tag would put a number that must
not fall into a ratchet built to make numbers fall.

The tier lives here because `the source has a defect` is a fact about
translating anything. Every INSTANCE names a construct of one corpus, so
instances are read from the PROJECT layer and nothing in this file knows one.

Everything about a marker is DATA
---------------------------------
The tag, the identifier, the text and the templates all come from the rule
documents. Nothing here knows the name of any individual deviation or defect,
so adding one is an edit to the data, and a census can enumerate them by
reading the same table the emitter did rather than by grepping for a string
somebody remembered.

A marker is a COMMENT. It must never change what the output does -- the moment a
marker can break a build, the pressure is to stop emitting markers.
