"""C# `const` fields: a folded value, not storage.

Generic C#. This module knows nothing about any corpus -- it asks the corpus
database one question, "is the type declaring this member a class or an enum",
and answers it the same way for any C# input.

A `const` field has no storage. The C# compiler folds its value into every use
site, and Roslyn hands us the folded constant on the reference itself. Reading
it as a field access emitted a struct member that cannot exist, and the calling
method was then withheld for reaching state the type does not have -- naming a
field that was never a field.

An enum member is ALSO a folded constant and must not take this path: the enum
rule maps it to a named Rust constant, which is better than a bare number and,
where the runtime already provides the constant, is the only correct output.
The two are told apart by the declaring type's kind, never by name.
