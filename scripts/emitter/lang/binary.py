"""A binary operator.

LANGUAGE LAYER. Generic C#; names nothing specific to any corpus.

Which operators exist and what each becomes is DATA -- `operators.binary` in the
generic rules. This module only decides that the node is one, and how the two
operands nest.

Three of them do not become operators. C# integer `+`, `-` and `*` wrap (or
throw, in a `checked` context) where Rust's operator panics-or-wraps by build
profile, and C# `<<`/`>>` mask the shift count where Rust's operator panics. All
three differences are invisible at the call site, so under
`docs/decisions/runtime-is-the-fourth-layer.md` they emit a CALL into
`csharp-rt`. `operators.runtime` in the data says which call; this module only
decides that the node qualifies.

    Three guards, each of which would produce code that does not compile if it

        `Nullable<T>`, which has no mapping yet at all.
