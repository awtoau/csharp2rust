# renode-rs — scorecard

Generated 2026-08-06T11:21:51+10:00 from `7cdbd51` by `scripts/scorecard.py`. **Do not edit by hand.**

Leading with the metrics that detect drift, not the ones that flatter it —
"files translated" is exactly what looked healthy in `linux-rs` while its rules
averaged 1.87 validation instances each.

## Health metrics

| metric | value | target | status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **compile-clean modules (the gate)** | 663 | ratchet, may only grow | PASS |
| platform floor (peripherals reachable end-to-end) | 48 / 65 | 65 | 74% |
| modules clean *and* drivable | 298 / 687 | — | 43% |
| oracle trace replay: peripherals at 0 divergence | 3 / 8 | 8 | partial |

> **The `rule` / `rule_instance` / `pattern_cluster` / `translation` SQL tables are

> tables were built for (see `docs/rulesdb-design.md`) was superseded by
> hand-authored JSON rule files read directly by `scripts/core/csharp_emitter.py` — see
> [docs/rule-engine-readiness.md](docs/rule-engine-readiness.md) and
> [docs/decisions/remove-the-cut.md](docs/decisions/remove-the-cut.md). A scorecard
> that reported `instances per rule` and `patches outstanding` from those tables
> read "0 rules committed, nothing translated" while 283 modules compiled clean —
> the metric measured the abandoned pipeline, not the one in use.

## Gates

Genuine stop points. A failed gate means stop, not retry.

### Current

| gate | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **two-tier compile gate** — modules with 0 rustc errors | 663 (ratchet, may only grow) | [docs/decisions/two-tier-compile-gate.md](docs/decisions/two-tier-compile-gate.md) |
| **the floor that runs** — peripherals reachable end-to-end | 48 / 65 | [docs/decisions/the-floor-that-runs.md](docs/decisions/the-floor-that-runs.md) |

### Historical (Phase 0/1)

| gate | doc's own verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** — is the Rust MMIO path faster? | PASS | [docs/perf-spike.md](docs/perf-spike.md) |
| **R3** — does the corpus collapse into clusters? | FAIL | [docs/census.md](docs/census.md) — coverage metric itself disputed by open issue #37 ("R3b — bare leaves are not rule failures") |
| **10** — do one peripheral's rules cover an unseen second? | PASS | [docs/phase1-gate.md](docs/phase1-gate.md) |

## Oracle tiers

| tier | what it proves | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — compiles | the crate builds | built |
| 2 — trace replay | per-peripheral register behaviour | built — 8 peripherals, 24 traces captured |
| 2.5 — interleaving | a critical section is not observed part-way through | built (#52) |
| 3 — instruction lockstep | full machine state vs C# | not built (#23) |
| 4 — boot equivalence | firmware reaches the prompt | **C# reference pinned** |
| 5 — CLI suite | commands behave identically | not built (#25) |

**Tier-2 replay, per peripheral** (from `generated_replay!()` in `src/renode-stm32/tests/generated_trace.rs`):

| module | trace | divergences | status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `renode_stm32::syscfg_registers` | `syscfg` | 0 | PASS |
| `renode_stm32::exti_registers` | `exti` | 0 | PASS |
| `renode_stm32::adc_registers` | `adc1` | 1192 | diverges |
| `renode_stm32::dma_registers` | `dma1` | 7 | diverges |
| `renode_stm32::dma_registers` | `dma2` | 616 | diverges |
| `renode_stm32::can_registers` | `can1` | 28 | diverges |
| `renode_stm32::gpio_registers` | `gpioPortA` | 3 | diverges |
| `renode_stm32::uart_registers` | `usart1` | 0 | PASS |

> **Threading is UNCERTIFIED.** Tier-2 replay is single-threaded, so a threading difference cannot appear in it by construction. The tier-2.5 harness can observe interleaving and is proven to fail when a lock is deleted (`scripts/check_sync_harness.py`) — but it has been pointed at no translated peripheral: 56 lock site(s) in the corpus, 0 in emitted Rust. Nothing here is evidence for or against D3.

## Severity — translated, but the semantics differ

| marker | sites in emitted Rust | what differs |
|---|---:|---|
| `WARN(condwrite)` | 5 | the source performs this access only under a guard; here it is UNCONDITIONAL. The guard reads state this declaration cannot see. |
| `WARN(eager)` | 6 | a lazy sequence became an owned collection: it is evaluated EAGERLY, so enumeration side effects and their order differ. |
| `SYNC(measure)` | 0 | C# `lock`. Structure preserved; TIMING IS NOT. |
| `WARN(multicast)` | 7 | a multicast event collapsed to ONE subscribe: there is no unsubscribe, and a second subscriber replaces the first. |
| `WARN(narrowed)` | 15 | a value outside the declared set has no variant here: the source keeps the number, this falls back to the default. |
| `WARN(orderby)` | 0 | ordering is a PASS-THROUGH: the key selector is discarded and the sequence keeps its source order. |
| **total** | **33** | |

A **gap** withholds the member, so it can never read as a translation. A **warning** emitted and is wrong in a stated way — the number is the count of sites carrying the marker, not the count of deviations declared, so a deviation that is declared and never marked reads as zero rather than as done.

> **2 declared deviation(s) mark nothing yet** — `measure`, `orderby`. Each has sites in the corpus and none of those sites reaches emitted Rust today: the members carrying them are withheld for unrelated reasons. The zero is a fact about how little is emitted, not evidence that the deviation is gone.

## Tests

Not built — no `docs/status/tests.json`.

Per-method tests are generated from tier-2 trace fixtures once the
harness exists (#34 R5). Until then a stub fails its test by construction,
which is the intended starting state: **0% passing over 100% of the corpus**
is a truthful scoreboard, an empty table is not.

## Converter

**The deliverable is the converter, not its output.** A hand-written
peripheral is not a translation, however well it passes its tests — both
current ones did, and one contained a `.with_reserved(9, 23)` call the C#
does not have.

| | |
|---|---|
| files produced by the converter | 1 (`uart_registers.rs`) |
| peripherals still hand-written | uart behaviour, gpio layout + behaviour |
| enforcement | none |

The UART's register layout is now generated and enforced byte-for-byte.
Deleting the hand-written version removed three edits that had survived
both the 33,164-access trace and mutation testing — including a
`.with_reserved(9, 23)` call the C# does not contain.

## Mutation score

What the tests can actually *see*. A passing trace replay means
"indistinguishable on this trace" — nothing about a green tick separates a
thorough trace from a useless one. Mutation testing is the only signal that does.

| target | mode | caught | viable | score | equivalent | survivors |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| gpio | all | 8 | 8 | 100.0% | 4 | 0 |
| uart | all | 30 | 37 | 81.1% | 0 | 7 **7** |

**Unresolved survivors** — each names a behaviour nothing checks:

- `uart` rw->read line 229: `.with_value(0, 9, &mut ValueId::default(), FieldMode::READ_W`
- `uart` rw->read line 255: `.with_flag(15, &mut f.oversampling_mode, FieldMode::READ_WRI`
- `uart` rw->read line 268: `.with_value(12, 2, &mut f.stop_bits, FieldMode::READ_WRITE)`
- `uart` read->rw line 220: `FieldMode::READ | FieldMode::WRITE_ZERO_TO_CLEAR,`
- `uart` and->or line 126: `if !self.bank.flag(self.f.usart_enabled) && !self.bank.flag(`
- `uart` and->or line 182: `&& !self.bank.flag(self.f.transmitter_enabled)`

## Benchmarks

Not built — no `docs/status/benchmarks.json`.

Tracked once there is a Rust emulator to measure (#26). The metrics are
fixed now so the series is comparable from its first point:

| metric | why |
|---|---|
| MMIO accesses/sec | the dominant cost; ~409 ns/access in C# today |
| instructions/sec | CPU throughput; ~50 MIPS in C# today |
| MMIO:instruction ratio | polling-heavy firmware lives or dies on this |
| wall : simulated ratio | the user-visible number (0.16× in C# today) |
| boot wall-clock | end-to-end, the one that matters in CI |

**Benchmarks must be pinned to a P-core.** Unpinned variance on this
hybrid host was ~50% from core migration; pinned it is ±2%.

## C# reference baseline

| | |
|---|---|
| Renode commit | `dc52b24c118a` |
| firmware ELF | `awto-htc.elf` `4eccbaee25d7` |
| markers in order | 8 / 8 |
| init steps | 19 (2 expected failures) |
| `system_boot OK` | 291 ms simulated |
| first output | host 26.57s / virt 7.16s (LSI-measurement cost) |
| real-time ratio | 0.16× |

> The real-time ratio is **contaminated**: `SystemBus::TryGetTag` is 12.78% of
> profile, driven by 16,827 accesses per boot to unmapped ADC_CCR
> (`0x40012304`). It measures Renode's error path as much as its speed.
