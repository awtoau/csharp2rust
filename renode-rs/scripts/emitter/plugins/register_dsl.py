"""Renode's register DSL: how a register is FOUND, and how a bank is emitted.

CORPUS LAYER. Everything here knows what a register, a bank, an offset enum and
a fluent combinator chain are, so none of it is generic C#. It lived in
`scripts/core/csharp_emitter.py` beside the driver, which meant the boundary between "knows
about Renode" and "orchestrates" was a convention rather than a file --
`scripts/check_layering.py` can only enforce the boundary where the boundary is
a directory.

What is here is the register DSL and nothing else:

  * FINDING a register -- the forms in `rulesdb/rules/` are data, but running
    them, reading an offset out of an enum member and splitting a computed
    offset into `<const> + <expr>` is the mechanism they drive.
  * EMITTING a bank -- the layout function, its preamble, the offset module,
    and a replicated child block as a submodule.
  * The two helpers that only the DSL uses: the `out` parameter that binds a
    field handle, and the combinator name behind a fully-qualified symbol.

What is deliberately NOT here: `emit_file`, `emit_peripheral_method`,
`state_fields`, `rewrite_this` and `base_chain` stay in the driver. A driver
reads both layers by definition -- `emit_file` asks this module for a bank and
the language layer for a method body, and pretending it belonged to one of them
would put the seam in the wrong place.

Mixin, not free functions, because every method reaches `self.con`,
`self.project`, `self.forms` and `self.gaps`. `Emitter` inherits it.
