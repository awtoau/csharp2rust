"""Dispatch registry for the emitter.

The point of this module is the LAYER BOUNDARY, which CLAUDE.md states as a
hard rule and which was previously only a convention about which JSON file a
rule lived in. `emit.py` handled `Binary` and `Conversion` -- generic C# -- in
the same file, and by the same mechanism, as Renode's register collection and
`this.Log`. Nothing structural stopped Renode knowledge leaking into the
transpiler; only care did, and care is not enforcement.

Two layers, and they are not peers:

    lang/     GENERIC C# to Rust. Must hold for ANY corpus. May not mention
              Renode, a peripheral, or a register -- `check_layering.py` fails
              the commit if it does.

    plugins/  Corpus-specific. Renode lives here, and so would anything else.
              Free to know about register banks and peripherals.

A plugin is consulted BEFORE the language layer, so a corpus idiom can override
a generic mapping -- which is what lets `IRQ.Set(x)` mean something particular
without the generic invocation rule knowing it exists.

Adding a construct is a new file in one directory or the other. Two people
adding two constructs touch two different files, which is what makes parallel
work on the transpiler safe.
