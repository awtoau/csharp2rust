"""C# constructors as an initialiser for the emitted state struct.

LANGUAGE LAYER -- see `scripts/check_layering.py`. Nothing here knows what is
being translated: a constructor is a member that assigns the object's own
fields, and that is true of any C# codebase.

WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE
---------------------
Nothing. The driver's member query asked for `kind='method'`, so `kind='ctor'`
was never selected, never emitted, and never gapped -- 32 of them in this cut.
The emitted struct derives `Default`, so every field a constructor assigned
started at 0/false and no output said so. That is the exact failure this
project keeps paying for: code that is wrong and silent is indistinguishable
from code that had nothing to do.

WHAT A CONSTRUCTOR BECOMES, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE THING
-------------------------------------------------------
A C# constructor body mixes three unrelated jobs:

  1. assigning the object's own fields;
  2. building things the emitted module already emits by another route;
  3. effects on OTHER objects -- wiring, event subscriptions, calls back into
     the type's own methods.

Only (1) is expressible as an initialiser for a plain data struct. So only (1)
is translated, into

    impl State {
        pub fn new(<the parameters those assignments read>) -> Self {
            let mut st = Self::default();
            ...
            st
        }
    }

and every statement that is not (1) is named as a gap. A `new` that quietly
skipped (2) and (3) would read as a complete constructor and would not be one.

WHY THE VALUE SIDE IS A WHITELIST
---------------------------------
An initialiser can reach nothing but the struct it is building. So the kinds
allowed inside an assigned value are listed in the rules and everything else is
withheld and named -- rather than blacklisting the shapes someone thought of.
A method call, an object construction or an event subscription in value
position is not a translation problem here, it is a statement that cannot exist
in this position at all.

WHY `Default` IS LEFT DERIVED
-----------------------------
Folding a constructor into `Default` needs every assigned value to be knowable
with no arguments. Where a field is assigned from a parameter, that is exactly
what is missing: the corpus records THAT a parameter has a default and not what
the default IS. A `Default` built from one would be a guess. So the derived
all-zero value stays -- an honest zero -- and the gap names the fields it
leaves wrong.

WHY THE CHAINED CALL IS A GAP AND NOT AN INLINE
-----------------------------------------------
`: base(x, 16)` runs the base constructor's own assignments with the derived
type's arguments substituted for the base's parameters. That substitution is a
real construct with its own correctness question, and doing it half way -- the
base's statements with its own parameter names still in them -- would put
values in the struct that no caller ever passed. It is named as a gap, per base
constructor, with what it costs.

EMPTY IS ALWAYS EXPLAINED
-------------------------
`emit` returns no lines when the type declares no constructor with a body, and
that is the one case where empty means "there was nothing" rather than "I could
not". Every other empty return carries at least one gap.
