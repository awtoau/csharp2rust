"""Expressions: the dispatch entry, and the helpers a construct shares.

LANGUAGE LAYER. Nothing here may name anything specific to the codebase being
translated; `scripts/check_layering.py` fails the commit if it does. Corpus
idioms live in `scripts/emitter/plugins/` and are consulted FIRST, so an idiom
can override any mapping without this module knowing it exists.

Templates come from `rulesdb/rules/csharp_core.json`. Nothing here decides what
the Rust says.

**One construct, one file.** This module used to hold every expression kind as
a branch in one `if kind == ...` chain, which meant two agents adding two
constructs edited one file and every new kind widened a shared function. Each
kind is now its own module in this directory, found by the registry in
`core.py`; what is left here is the dispatch entry and the handful of helpers
more than one construct calls.

The two rules that are load-bearing kept their reasoning with them, in the
files they moved to:

  * A reference emits its RECEIVER (`reference.py`). Dropping it turned
    `queue.Count` into `self.count()` -- reading the wrong object -- and did so
    for 26% of all references while both generated files stayed byte-identical
    and correct, because the two types converted at the time reached their
    state through `this`.

  * An implicit NUMERIC conversion becomes an explicit cast (`conversion.py`).
    C# widens silently and Rust never does, so `16.0` emitted as `16` turned an
    f64 division into integer division that compiled and passed every test.
