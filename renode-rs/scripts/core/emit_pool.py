"""Run the emitter over many types at once, and get the SAME BYTES as at -j1.

Why this exists
---------------
Removing the corpus cut took the corpus from 21,620 lines to 448,375, and the
number of emitted modules from 24 to 569. The census scripts kept emitting them
one `Emitter` at a time, so `gap_census.py` went to ~6 min and
`compile_check.py` to ~15 min. `compile_check --ratchet` is in the pre-commit
hook, which is how a slow check turns into a process defect rather than an
inconvenience: the last several commits were made with the hook SKIPPED.

CLAUDE.md is explicit that conversion wall-clock is the iteration speed, and
this repo has already found three checks that reported success while verifying
nothing. A hook that is bypassed is the same outcome by a different route.

This module is the shared driver loop. It is NOT part of the emitter: it
creates `Emitter` instances and collects what they return, and knows nothing
about what they emit.

THE CONSTRAINT: byte-identical at -j1 and the parallel default
----------------------------------------------
`emit_many` returns results in the order of the tasks it was given, never in
completion order. That is the whole guarantee, and it is not an accident of
`Executor.map` -- it is the reason `map` is used here instead of
`as_completed`, which would be faster to first result and silently wrong.

Silently wrong, specifically, because the output would still be VALID. A gap
census aggregated in completion order produces the same TOTAL with a different
tie-break order in `Counter.most_common` and a different "one example per
category" -- a real diff, in a file that looks entirely reasonable. That is the
worst failure available here, and it is the one `scripts/check_determinism.py`
exists to refuse.

So, three rules for anything using this module:

  1. Consume the returned list in order. Do not re-sort it by anything but a
     total order derived from the task list itself.
  2. Aggregate INTO the caller, in that order. A `Counter` summed in a
     different order has different `most_common` ties; a `dict.setdefault`
     filled in a different order keeps a different first example.
  3. Do not let a worker write to anything shared. Workers return values.

Processes, not threads
----------------------
This interpreter is a free-threading build with the GIL off, so threads would
in principle parallelise. They are not used, for two reasons:

  * `Emitter` carries mutable per-instance state (`self.gaps`, `self.unhandled`,
    `self._flag_fields`, `self._loop_env`, ...) and has never been audited for
    thread safety. Auditing it means changing it, and the emitter is owned by
    other work.
  * A process pool is correct on a GIL-enabled interpreter too. A thread pool
    would silently stop parallelising on one, and "silently stops doing its
    job" is the exact failure class this repo keeps paying for.

Each worker builds its OWN `Emitter` with its OWN read-only SQLite connection,
so nothing mutable is shared at all. Concurrent readers of one SQLite file are
safe: read-only (`mode=ro`) connections take shared locks for the duration of a
statement and no writer exists.

Work-stealing, not static partitioning
--------------------------------------
The machine is heterogeneous -- 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores -- so a static split
would leave the P-cores idle waiting on the E-cores. Tasks go onto one shared
queue with `chunksize=1`, so a worker takes the next type the moment it is
free and a fast core simply takes more of them. CLAUDE.md requires this.

Tasks are additionally handed out LONGEST-FIRST (`--no-lpt` to disable): the
corpus is wildly uneven -- one type emits 1,192 gaps and most emit none -- so
with tasks in name order the pool finishes in the time of whatever big type
happens to be last. Ordering by descending cost is the classic LPT scheduling
heuristic. It changes the ORDER WORK IS ISSUED, never the order results are
returned, so it cannot affect the output; `--no-lpt` exists so that can be
proved rather than asserted.
