"""Measure what inheritance actually costs, so issue #56 is decided on numbers.

Issue #56 asks whether a derived type's base should be MERGED (base members
become siblings of the derived members in one flat `State`, which is what the
emitter does today) or EMBEDDED (`struct Derived { parent: Base, ... }`, which
is what IL2CPP, Servo, QEMU and c2rust all do). That question was argued in
`docs/research/inheritance.md` and never measured, so this measures it.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A TABLE IN A DOC
-------------------------------------
CLAUDE.md forbids a second source of truth. A hand-typed "10 derived types, 9
base calls" in a decision doc is a copy that drifts the moment the cut changes
-- and the decision would keep citing a number that stopped being true, while
reading exactly as it did when it was. So the numbers live in
`docs/status/inheritance.json`, this script produces them, and the doc points
at the file.

WHAT IS COUNTED, AND WHAT EACH NUMBER DECIDES
---------------------------------------------
1. `chains`      -- every class's ancestor chain, and where it leaves the cut.
                    Decides how much of the problem either model can even see:
                    a base outside the cut cannot be flattened OR embedded,
                    because its members are unknown.

2. `collisions`  -- a member name declared at two levels of one chain. MERGE
                    puts both in one struct and one of them is lost; EMBED
                    cannot collide, because the base's members live behind a
                    field. This is the measurement that most directly separates
                    the two models, so it is counted twice: on the C# name, and
                    on the snake_case name the emitter actually writes (two C#
                    names can collide only after snake-casing).

3. `base_access` -- every site in derived code that reaches a member declared
                    on an ancestor: `base.X()`, an inherited call through
                    `this`, a read of a protected base field. Each carries what
                    it costs under each model, so the cost is a sum over real
                    sites rather than an opinion.

4. `overrides`   -- virtual/override/abstract counts, and how many overrides
                    shadow a base member of the same name. The shadowed set is
                    exactly the set MERGE must invent a qualified name for.

NOT MEASURED HERE, DELIBERATELY
-------------------------------
Whether the output is CORRECT. Per CLAUDE.md only trace replay can say that, and
traces exist for a handful of peripherals, not for a layout choice. This counts
shapes and sites; it makes no claim about behaviour.

ONE CORPUS NOW, AND STILL ONLY A DISCOVERY TIER
-----------------------------------------------
This used to run over two corpora and write two files, because the cut had 29
classes with a base -- too small a population for "zero collisions" to mean
anything, and it duly reported that base and derived field names never collide.
They do; the cut could not see it.

The cut is gone (docs/decisions/remove-the-cut.md), so there is one corpus:

    python3 scripts/inheritance_census.py
        -> docs/status/inheritance.json            the whole Renode tree

A wider corpus does not promote this above DISCOVERY. Counting shapes is not
validating output, and the tier line in the file says so.

`docs/status/inheritance-breadth.json` is kept as the exact artefact
docs/decisions/inheritance-layout.md cites; it is no longer regenerated, because
it would now be a byte-for-byte second copy of the file above.

        say so or a reader takes the new zero for the old question's answer.
        `state_fields` now WITHHOLDS every copy of a colliding name and reports
        a gap, so `n_types_with_duplicate_fields` is the count of collisions the
        guard MISSED and must stay 0. The population that used to be counted
        there is now `n_types_guarded`: types whose struct would not have
        compiled and which now name the collision instead.
