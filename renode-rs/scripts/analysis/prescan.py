"""Classify every instance field's ownership, with the evidence for each.

The ownership decision has been made globally so far -- D1 says "every
reference-typed field becomes Rc<RefCell<T>>" -- and all four research reports
independently found that every working system does it PER SITE, with recorded
evidence and a legal UNKNOWN. Bun's LIFETIMES.tsv is the production example:
columns `file · struct · field · type · class · rust_type · evidence`, and the
instruction to its agents was "trust it over local guessing".

This is that table, computed from the corpus.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
STATIC evidence only. It sees declared types, reachability in the type graph,
and how often each field is read and written -- not what actually happens at
run time. A field that is never null in every real execution still looks
nullable here, and a cycle that is never traversed still looks like a cycle.

The dynamic half is the more valuable one and is not built: instrument C#
Renode, record which objects are genuinely shared, cyclic and long-lived, and
merge that in. c2rust-analyze runs the program to build a pointer derivation
graph precisely because static analysis cannot answer this; `pyrs` used
MonkeyType the same way. We can already run Renode and already capture traces,
so the instrumentation point exists.

Until then every row says `static` in its evidence column, and that word is
load-bearing: it means the classification is a starting point, not a verdict.
