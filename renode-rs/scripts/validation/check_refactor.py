"""Prove a refactor changed no output. The whole point of a byte oracle.

The converter takes N inputs and produces N files. So a refactor is not a
judgement call about risk -- it either produces the same bytes or it does not,
and this says which. Run it before starting (`--record`) and after every step.

It compares more than the seven committed peripherals, because those are the
ones already known to work and a refactor that only preserves them has proved
the easy half. It also compares the gap census and the compile census, which
between them cover every type in the cut.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_refactor.py --record   # before
      python3 scripts/check_refactor.py            # after, exits 1 on any diff
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_refactor.log

The nine `csharp_emitter.py` runs go in parallel; the two censuses stay SEQUENTIAL,
because each of them now saturates every core on its own and running them
together would only make each wait for the other. The censuses dominate this
script's wall-clock, and they were made parallel internally -- see
scripts/emit_pool.py.

Parallel here is safe for a reason worth stating: each job is a separate
`csharp_emitter.py` process writing nothing but its own stdout, results are keyed by
artefact name, and the comparison below iterates `sorted(current)`. Nothing
reads a completion order.
