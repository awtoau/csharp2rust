"""The two guards the inheritance-layout decision turns on. Pre-commit.

Both were taken from `docs/decisions/inheritance-layout.md`, and both guard a
failure that COMPILES. Neither can be checked by reading the output, which is
why they are executed.

1. STRICT DISPATCH RESOLUTION
   A trait method must forward to the PLAIN emitted name or leave the trait.
   The obvious resolver falls back to the `{base}_{name}` copy -- and run that
   way it gave three of four implementors a `reset` that ran the BASE's body,
   because each overrides it in C# and each override was withheld for an
   unrelated reason. Wrong virtual dispatch, in code that compiles and passes
   its trace.

   So this asserts BOTH halves, and the second matters as much as the first:

     a. under the strict resolver no forward names a qualified copy;
     b. under the permissive resolver at least one does.

   (b) is what stops this becoming a check that verifies nothing. If the
   permissive resolver ever stops demonstrating the bug -- because the corpus
   moved, or because every override started emitting -- then (a) passing means
   nothing, and the check says so instead of reporting success.

2. THE FIELD-COLLISION GUARD
   Two levels of one chain declaring the same field name merge into a struct
   that declares it twice: rustc E0124, and the type does not compile at all.
   The guard turns that into a named gap.

   Today's cut has ZERO collisions, so this guard fires on nothing in it -- and
   an unfired guard is worth nothing; this project has shipped three checks that
   reported success while verifying nothing. So the check builds a two-level
   corpus that DOES collide, in memory, and asserts the guard fires on it. It
   also asserts the guard does NOT fire on a corpus that does not collide,
   because a guard that always fires is equally worthless.

   If `tmp/breadth.db` is present it additionally REPORTS how many tree-wide
   types the guard fires on. Reported, never asserted: breadth is a discovery
   corpus and is not always there.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_inheritance.py
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_inheritance.log
Exit: 0 clean, 1 if either guard is broken or has stopped being able to fire.
