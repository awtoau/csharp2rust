"""Breadth health check: does the ingest tooling survive the whole Renode tree?

WHAT THIS IS: a smoke test for the tooling. It runs the walker over all ~1,708
files and asserts the tool neither crashes nor loses data silently.

IT NO LONGER READS MORE THAN A NORMAL RUN. The corpus cut is gone
(docs/decisions/remove-the-cut.md), so the canonical ingest already walks every
file. `--all` now declares the run's PURPOSE rather than its scope: the output
is SCRATCH. It goes to tmp/, it is tagged `config = 'breadth'`, and every
rule/cluster consumer refuses a database with that tag.

That fence is still worth having, and not because it gates tiering -- the
`committed` tier is keyed on `oracle_tier > 0` now
(scripts/check_commit_tier.py), so a run's config cannot manufacture confidence.
It is worth having because a smoke test can be interrupted, re-run mid-walk, or
left half-written, and overwriting the canonical corpus with one is a real way
to lose a corpus.

It is cheap enough to run routinely (~55s), which is the only reason it is worth
having: Renode is small enough that full coverage costs almost nothing, unlike
the kernel corpus this method was borrowed from.

Silent loss is the point. The first breadth run threw zero exceptions and still
had 5,123 methods (24.7%) claiming a body while emitting no operations, because
`partial void Foo();` is neither abstract nor extern. Nothing crashed. The
assertions below are what caught it.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_breadth.py [--threads 32]
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_breadth.log
Exit: 0 healthy, 1 a tooling defect.
