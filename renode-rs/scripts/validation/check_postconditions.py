"""Enforce `postcondition` -- the SHAPE a rule's output must have.

`check_rule_negatives.py` is the model, and the difference is the direction.
A `negative` is a statement about the INPUT: shapes a rule must not be chosen
for. A `postcondition` is a statement about the OUTPUT: what the emitted text
must look like once the rule has run. Until now the second did not exist, so a
rule could be selected perfectly and emit something nobody had ever described.

That is not hypothetical. A combinator appeared in a translated file that the
C# does not contain -- behaviourally inert, so a 33,000-access trace could not
see it, and shaped like every other line, so review did not either.

Three checks, and the first two need no corpus:

  every emitting rule HAS one
      A rule with an `emit` template and no `postcondition` is unchecked
      output. Counted and failed, so the number ratchets rather than drifting.

  the TEMPLATE satisfies it
      Slots are filled with a placeholder and the postcondition run over the
      result. Catches a postcondition that contradicts the template it is
      attached to -- an `arity` that was right before a slot was added, say --
      at review time and on any corpus.

  the OUTPUT satisfies it, at every site
      The real arm selection and the real emitter over every combinator call
      in the corpus. This is the half the template check cannot do: a forbidden
      shape can arrive through a SUBSTITUTED slot, and only the output shows
      that. `emit_call` raises on violation, so this is exercised rather than
      re-implemented.

Exit 1 on any violation. Log: tmp/logs/check_postconditions.log.
