"""Refuse a source-defect stanza that has lost its evidence. Pre-commit gate.

WHAT A BUG RULE IS
------------------
A defect in the C# BEING TRANSLATED, recorded as data. The fourth rule class --
see docs/decisions/bug-rules-are-a-fourth-class.md. The other three classes all
answer "how do I express this construct?"; this one answers "the source is
wrong, and I know it", which none of them had anywhere to put.

WHAT A BUG RULE IS NOT
----------------------
It is NOT a way to find or fix a translation defect, and nothing here should be
described as if it were. Our Rust is wrong when it differs from THE C#; a
datasheet adds nothing to that comparison. It says something new only where the
Rust matches the C# and both differ from silicon -- which is not a translation
defect at all. On bxCAN, zero of 99 divergences were diagnosed by reading ST.

What it IS for is preventing a wrong "fix". Several of these look exactly like
OUR bug to anyone reading the datasheet, and correcting one toward the hardware
breaks a passing trace, because the oracle certifies equivalence with the C#.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHY EACH ONE
----------------------------------
The decision names four fields a bug rule carries that an ordinary rule does
not, and a stanza that loses any of them stops being a bug rule and becomes an
opinion. Prose in a JSON file decays exactly as quietly as prose in a comment
did, so the four are checked rather than reviewed:

  site         file and line, plus the C# text at that line. VERIFIED against
               the source when RENODE_SRC is set -- Renode moves, and a stanza
               pointing at a line that now says something else is worse than
               no stanza, because it reads as evidence.
  authority    a citation, not a claim. A disagreement with no third source is
               a SUSPICION and belongs in `rejected`, not here.
  mode         must be `fidelity` in committed data. Conformance is a
               deliberate act at the call site (`csharp_emitter.py --conformance ID`),
               never a state the repository can be left in.
  switch_impact  MEASURED, by scripts/measure_bug_switch.py. A bug rule whose
               switch-impact is unknown is not finished -- that is the field
               that makes throwing the switch safe rather than a coin flip.

It also checks that each stanza REACHES the output. A stanza matching nothing
emits no marker, which is indistinguishable from having no stanza; that is the
failure mode the doc comment in uart.rs already had.

A CHECK NOBODY HAS SEEN FAIL IS NOT A CHECK
-------------------------------------------
`--prove` mutates the committed stanzas in memory, one field at a time, and
asserts this check REJECTS each mutant. Without it the passing run above is
equally consistent with the check doing nothing, and this project has already
shipped one gate that was passing because it was being skipped.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_bug_rules.py
      python3 scripts/check_bug_rules.py --prove
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_bug_rules.log
Exit: 0 clean, 1 if any stanza has lost its evidence.
