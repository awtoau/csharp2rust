"""Compile EVERYTHING the converter emits, and classify what rustc says.

The gap census answers "what does the converter know it cannot do". This
answers a different and harsher question: **of the code it was confident
enough to emit, how much actually compiles?**

Those are not the same, and until now we only had the first. Two peripherals
are wired into the workspace and compiled on every commit; the other twenty-odd
types the converter can emit have never been near a compiler. c2rust emits
output >99.99% of the time and only 72.64% of it runs -- "we emitted it" is
worth very little on its own.

Method is the one the literature keeps arriving at independently:

  * Laertes uses the Rust compiler as an oracle, and argues you must, because
    "the analysis must be tuned to be no more precise than the Rust compiler".
  * Bun grouped ~16,000 `cargo check` errors into a work queue.
  * Corrode's `corrode-cc` fell back to the real compiler on failure and
    hash-deduped each error message into a file, giving a free coverage metric.

An error CODE is a better work item than a gap, because rustc has already
classified the problem and pointed at the span.

Nothing is written to the repo: the scratch crate lives under tmp/.

Full rationale and the measured numbers: docs/decisions/two-tier-compile-gate.md

TWO TIERS
---------
    --working-set --ratchet   FAST. Compiles the declared clean set plus the
                              types the working diff names. Pre-commit.
    --ratchet                 FULL. All 569. Before a push, and on demand.

The fast tier says what it did NOT check, every run. A gate over a subset that
is quiet about its edges is exactly how the corpus cut hid four platform
peripherals for weeks while every number over it looked healthy.

THE GATE IS THE CLEAN SET, NOT THE ERROR TOTAL
----------------------------------------------
It used to be a ratchet on the total, and that had stopped being a gate. With
3,072 errors over 567 modules, 50 new errors is a 1.6% rise -- a broken rule
that takes out whole modules passes unnoticed. `compile_baseline.json` said so
itself under `why_this_ratchet_is_now_weaker`.

So the gate is per-module over the modules that compile CLEAN
(docs/status/compile_clean_set.json, declared data, may only grow). A module
leaving that set is unambiguous and attributable to one file. A module that
already fails can get worse and this will not notice -- stated plainly rather
than covered by a total that could not see it either.

Run:  python3 scripts/compile_check.py --working-set --ratchet   # fast tier
      python3 scripts/compile_check.py --ratchet                 # full tier
      python3 scripts/compile_check.py --record-clean-set        # grow the gate
      python3 scripts/compile_check.py --keep     # leave the crate for poking
      python3 scripts/compile_check.py -j1        # serial, for the byte oracle
Log:  ./tmp/logs/compile_check.log
Exit: 0, or 1 if a declared-clean module stopped compiling.

Emission runs on every core (scripts/emit_pool.py). THE EMITTED CRATE AND THIS
REPORT ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL AT EVERY `-j`. That matters more here than anywhere
else: this is the pre-commit compile gate, and a gate whose number moves with
the scheduler is a gate that fails at random and gets skipped. It was already
being skipped for taking ~15 min.
