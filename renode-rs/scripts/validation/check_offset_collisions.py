"""No two `bank.define` calls in one bank may share an offset.

WHAT IT CATCHES
---------------
`Bank::done()` finishes with

    self.bank.registers.insert(self.offset, reg);

and `registers` is a `BTreeMap`. `insert` on an occupied key REPLACES. So a
second `bank.define` at an offset the module already defined does not error,
does not warn, and does not leave a gap -- it destroys the first register and
the module still compiles, still runs, and still passes its trace for every
offset that was not overwritten.

`STM32F4_FlashController` does exactly this today. The C# has TWO register
collections:

    Registers.AccessControl          = 0x0     reached via the flash region
    OptionBytesRegisters.ReadProtectionAndUser = 0x0   via the option-bytes region
    Registers.OptionKey              = 0x8
    OptionBytesRegisters.WriteProtection       = 0x8

Two collections, two connection regions, offsets deliberately reused. The
emitter drops the collection argument and merges both into one bank, so
FLASH_ACR and FLASH_OPTKEYR are silently replaced by the option-bytes
registers that follow them.

WHY THIS IS A CONVERTER CHECK AND NOT A FLASH CHECK
---------------------------------------------------
The defect is not "FlashController is wrong". It is "the converter has no model
of a peripheral with more than one register collection", and the shape of the
loss -- a later definition eating an earlier one -- is a property of the
emitted DSL, not of any peripheral. Any C# type with two collections will do
this, and the corpus scan below is how we know how many do (one, today).

Reported as a named failure rather than a warning: a warning about a register
that no longer exists is indistinguishable from noise once there are twenty of
them, and the register really is gone.

SCOPE, STATED
-------------
Offsets are compared only where they are compile-time constants. A sub-block
defines at `reg::BASE + (stream_offset) as u64`, where the addend is a runtime
value, and those are counted and listed as unresolved rather than guessed at.
Today that is the DMA streams and nothing else. A collision hidden inside a
sub-block's computed offset would not be caught -- said here so that it is a
known limit rather than an assumed absence.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_offset_collisions.py
      python3 scripts/check_offset_collisions.py --self-test
Log:  ./tmp/logs/check_offset_collisions.log
Exit: 1 on a collision. FAILS TODAY (FlashController); do not put it in the
      pre-commit hook until it is fixed.

FLOOR: 1 module / 2 colliding offsets, at 2026-08-02. The right floor for this
one is ZERO, not a ratchet: a collision is not a rough edge to be traded down
over time, it is a register that does not exist. Wire it into the hook the day
the emitter carries the collection argument through, and let it be a hard
gate from then on.
