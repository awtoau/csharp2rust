"""Plot converter progress across git history.

One report, two charts, both read from git history alone -- no rebuild.

## Chart 1: generated Rust versus gaps versus correctness

Three lines that must be read together:

  generated lines     how much Rust the converter produces
  reported gaps       how much it refuses to produce
  trace divergences   how much of what it produced is WRONG

Neither of the first two is a score on its own, and that is the point of
graphing them together. Lines went UP for weeks while several of those lines
were wrong -- an emitted `/* GAP */` marker inside a loop, a base call that
recursed forever. When withholding on gap markers landed, generated lines FELL
by 22 and the output got better. A single "progress" number would have shown
that as regression.

THE THIRD LINE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MEASURES CORRECTNESS, and it is free.
Trace replay is this project's one oracle, and each peripheral's known
divergence count is a committed constant in the replay harness -- a ratchet
that may fall but never rise. So the measurement is already in git history and
needs no re-execution: `git show <sha>:<harness>` and read the numbers. Lines
and gaps say how much was attempted; only this says how much behaves.

Two things to read carefully on that line, because both look like something
they are not:

  * It ROSE once, 8,042 to 8,155, when a trace was ADDED. More divergences
    because more is measured, not because anything regressed. The total is not
    comparable across a change in how many traces run -- only within one.
  * It sat FLAT at 7,559 for eleven consecutive commits. Those commits were
    real work, and some of it was necessary before anything else could move.
    But eleven commits of no measured correctness change is exactly the thing
    a lines-only graph would have drawn as steady progress.

## Chart 2: the compile-clean-module gate

`docs/status/compile_clean_set.json` is the RATCHET (see
`docs/decisions/two-tier-compile-gate.md`): a module in the set must never
leave it, so the set's SIZE only grows or holds. Reading it at each commit
that touched it is cheap -- `git show <sha>:<path>` -- and needs no rebuild,
unlike the error TOTAL, which is a live `cargo build` measurement
(`compile_check.py`) with no historical record: it is explicitly "a trend, not
a gate" and was never committed per-commit, so it cannot be graphed
retroactively without rebuilding every past commit's full corpus output.

So this chart has one line, not three: clean-module count.

Self-contained SVG, no plotting library: the repo has no Python dependencies
and adding one for a chart is a poor trade.

Run:  python3 scripts/reports/progress_graph.py
Out:  ./docs/status/progress.html -- TRACKED, the only output file. A report
      is a deliverable, not scratch: this lived in gitignored tmp/ and was
      destroyed by every clean; the page is the only artefact that shows the
      correctness line falling over time, and it cannot be reconstructed from
      a number. Both charts are inline SVG in this one page -- no separate
      .svg files, so there is one command and one committed artifact, not
      three.
