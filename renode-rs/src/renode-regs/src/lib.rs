//! Renode's register DSL, in Rust. Issue #12.
//!
//! This is the single highest-leverage translation in the project: 2,538 lines
//! of C# implementing 20 combinators that the peripheral corpus calls 1,109
//! times. Getting it right makes most of every peripheral translate by rule.
//!
//! # Storage — decision D2
//!
//! Fields live in one contiguous `Vec<Cell<u64>>` per peripheral, and a field
//! handle is a typed index rather than a pointer. The C# maps naturally onto one
//! `Rc<RefCell<_>>` per field, and that was measured (`debris/code/field-layout-spike`):
//! 1.1–1.7x slower depending on workload, roughly half of it the borrow-flag
//! read-modify-write.
//!
//! **That speed difference is not why this design was chosen.** A field read is
//! 0.34 ns against a ~409 ns per-MMIO-access budget — 0.08%, a rounding error.
//! The reasons are correctness: `Cell` has no borrow flag so re-entrant access
//! cannot panic (peripheral → bus → peripheral is a real path in Renode), and an
//! index-based bank is `Send`, which `Rc` blocks and which N-instance test
//! parallelism needs.
//!
//! # Callbacks
//!
//! The C# attaches `valueProviderCallback` / `writeCallback` closures to fields.
//! Those closures capture `this`, and a closure capturing `self` cannot be
//! stored inside `self` — reaching it needs `&self.bank` while calling it needs
//! `&mut self`.
//!
//! The closures capture `this` only because C# gives them no other way to reach
//! the peripheral. **Passing it as a parameter removes the cycle entirely**, so
//! callbacks live here in the DSL exactly as they do in the C#:
//!
//! - the bank needs only `&self`, because `Cell` provides interior mutability;
//! - peripheral state arrives as `&mut S`, a *disjoint* field borrow;
//! - the field index arrives as a parameter, covering the C# plural
//!   combinators' captured loop variable (`(idx, _) => mode[idx]`).
//!
//! An earlier version of this file claimed the callbacks could not be expressed
//! and moved them into the peripheral's `read`/`write` dispatch. That was wrong,
//! and it mattered: it would have made every callback-bearing field a hand-written
//! dispatch arm rather than a rule, which is most of the corpus.
//!
//! # Faithfulness
//!
//! Field semantics — `FieldMode`, callback ordering, reset behaviour — mirror
//! the C# exactly. Where Rust forces a difference it is recorded on the rule,
//! never applied silently.
