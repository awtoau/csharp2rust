//! Runtime support for translated C#.
//!
//! Types that C# has and Rust does not, needed so a translation can be faithful
//! rather than approximate. Nothing here knows what is being translated: no
//! peripheral, no register, no emulator. It is the C#-to-Rust analogue of
//! IL2CPP's `libil2cpp` — the part of the source language that has to exist
//! somewhere once the syntax is gone.
//!
//! A type earns its place here only when the approximation is *observably*
//! different. `Queue<T>` does not: `VecDeque` matches it. `T[,]` does, and the
//! reason is below.
//!
//! ## The rule for what belongs here
//!
//! `docs/decisions/runtime-is-the-fourth-layer.md`: a mapping belongs in the
//! runtime when the semantic **cannot be checked at the call site**. Three
//! tells, any one sufficient — it needs state or a data structure, it has an
//! error mode, or the template spells the operation out rather than naming it.
//! Everything else stays a template in `rulesdb/rules/csharp_core.json`;
//! `ConditionalOr` → `||` is a rename and must not move here.
//!
//! What that admitted, and why each one is not a template:
//!
//! * [`Array2D`] — C# `T[,]`. Needs a data structure (a stride).
//! * [`arith`] — C#'s unchecked/checked integer arithmetic and its masked
//!   shift counts. Error mode (`OverflowException`), and the shift mask is an
//!   implementation rather than a rename.
//! * [`linq`] — `OrderBy` (needs to buffer the sequence) and `First` (error
//!   mode). The rest of LINQ is a rename and stayed in the rules.
//! * [`collections`] — `Dictionary.Add`, which throws on a duplicate key
//!   where `insert` overwrites. Error mode. The rest of the BCL collections
//!   are renames and stayed in the rules.
//! * [`delegate`] — a C# delegate's `+=`. Needs state: which subscriber(s) a
//!   single callback slot already holds.

/// A C# rectangular array, `T[,]`.
///
/// The obvious mapping is `Vec<Vec<T>>`, and it is wrong in three ways that
/// only one of which is cosmetic:
///
/// 1. **Raggedness becomes possible.** C# fixes every row at the same length
///    when the array is created and the type system enforces it. `Vec<Vec<T>>`
///    permits rows of differing length, so a translation bug can produce a
///    shape the source could not represent — and it is legal Rust, so nothing
///    catches it.
/// 2. **Initialisation differs.** `new string[3, 4]` yields twelve usable
///    slots immediately. `Vec<Vec<T>>` starts empty, so unless every emitted
///    construction remembers to fill it, the first index panics. That is a
///    correctness trap that depends on an emitter rule being remembered.
/// 3. **Layout differs** — one allocation versus N+1. Cosmetic here, since
///    nothing in this corpus depends on layout, but it is the reason the other
///    two follow.
///
/// So this is one flat `Vec` plus the row width (the *stride*), with indexing
/// computed the way C# computes it. Raggedness is unrepresentable, and the
/// constructor forces initialisation.
