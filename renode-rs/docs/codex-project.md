# Codex project clauses

This repository builds a general, rule-driven C#-to-Rust transpiler. Renode is
the corpus and differential oracle, not the deliverable.

- Change the emitter or rule data; never hand-edit generated Rust.
- Match rules on corpus facts, never peripheral, register, or type names.
- Withhold and report unsupported output instead of emitting a plausible guess.
- The sandbox has no network. Do not re-ingest, run `gh`, or fetch dependencies.
- During iteration, run `python3 scripts/dev.py build` to compile the known-clean
  set plus touched types. Before finishing, run `python3 scripts/dev.py gate`.
  Generated files must stay byte-identical and trace-divergence ratchets must
  not rise.
